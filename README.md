# PHP Database Communicator
A Repository for some php helper class i'm building to help connect to mysql queries, and build and manage queries.

My motivation for this api began when I started to develop web apps in php
 to communicate with my MYSQL databased. I found that a lot of errors I was 
 getting were mostly in silly query syntax mistakes. This class attempts to 
 eliminate the worry of syntactically correct queries. 

This class further aims to protect users from dangerously constructed 
queries such as a Delete query that has no conditions, so it targets the 
whole table


Features as of Version 0.2

- INSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE queries passed initial testing
- Can add conditions to queries
- Clearer Error messaging allowing for users to better identify issues
- Query Type Selection

Upcoming Features:

- Working on the Update Function
